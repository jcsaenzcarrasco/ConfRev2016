Short version of ET-trees operations

The source code included in the present repository was developed by Juan Carlos Saenz and Paolo Veronelli. The aim is to develop and test Euler tour representation for dynamic trees through functional Finger Trees. 

Some of the literature we based the work on:

"Dynamic trees in practice" by Robert Tarjan and Renato Werneck (JEA 2009); 
"Design and Analysis of Data Structures for Dynamic Trees" by Renato Werneck (Princeton University, 2006); 
"Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure" by Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson (JFP 2006)
